# Eye-Blink
This project may be used in the medical field for eye diseases such as  :   -dry eyes
                                                                            -Eyelid Spasms
                                                                            -Some neurological and psychological problems
                                                                            -Vision Problems
Steps that were followed to implement this project : 1- importing libraries
                                                     2- Determine the coordinates of the eye
                                                     3- we compute the eye aspect ratio  for each eye, which gives us a singular value, relating the distances between the                                                             vertical eye landmark points to the distances between the horizontal landmark points 
                                                     4- after getting the ratio avg we can  specify if the eye is closed or not
